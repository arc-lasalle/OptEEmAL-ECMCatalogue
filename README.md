# ECM Catalogue / Instance Creator

ECM Catalogue / Instance Creator is system that takes advantage of the capabilities of Semantic Web technologies to integrate ECM data into BEP simulation models in an automated way. The system is composed of a catalogue of ECM measures described in Resource Description Framework (RDF) and a software component that facilitates their application in the models. The system has been developed in the context of OptEEmAL, a research project aimed at creating a web platform to facilitate building simulations at district scale. The applicability of the system is demonstrated in a case study of a district-scale project.

Today the technology has improved and a wide range of applications are possible including technologies for electricity generation and for solar cooling. Therefore, it can be considered a technology with a high potential of contribution in meeting climate change objectives considering that the proportion of thermal energy in the final energy demand is very important]]></description>    </level>  </ecm_catalogue>  <component_catalogue>    <level id="7">      <application><![CDATA[_Systems with natural (thermosiphon) and forced (pump) circulation._Solar domestic hot water heating in buildings._Solar combi-systems for domestic hot water and space heating._Swimming pool heating.]]></application>      <functional_unit unit="1480"><![CDATA[2 m2]]></functional_unit>      <advantages><![CDATA[_Solar heating systems are compatible with almost all the heat support systems._The main costs of the technology are incurred in the initial investment due to the minimal operational costs.

The connetion between panels is a must for pressurized systems. If the connection is not 100% perfect fluid will leak from the system and it will begin to perform poorly in a short amonut of time._Lineset Penetration. The linset penetration is the point where most leaks will occur so its critical that the penetrations through the roof and the membrane used will keep water out. ]]></maintenance_data>      <estimated_service_life unit="year"><![CDATA[25]]></estimated_service_life>      <other_information_1><![CDATA[[null]]]></other_information_1>      <other_information_2><![CDATA[[null]]]></other_information_2>      <gwp_-_production_impact_a1-3 unit="kG eq CO2/unit"><![CDATA[192,350908035005]]></gwp_-_production_impact_a1-3>      <gwp_-_end_of_life_impact_c1-4 unit="kG eq CO2/unit"><![CDATA[42,93352824588]]></gwp_-_end_of_life_impact_c1-4>      <pec_-_production_impact_a1-3 unit="MJ/unit"><![CDATA[3200,9371604124]]></pec_-_production_impact_a1-3>      <pec_-_end_of_life_impact_c1-4 unit="MJ/unit"><![CDATA[1341,08524453428]]></pec_-_end_of_life_impact_c1-4>      <sale_price unit="â‚¬/functional unit"><![CDATA[1184]]></sale_price>      <installation_cost unit="â‚¬/functional unit"><![CDATA[296]]></installation_cost>      <maintenance_cost unit="â‚¬/functional unitÂ·year"><![CDATA[250]]></maintenance_cost>      <end_of_life_cost unit="â‚¬/functional unit"><![CDATA[23,68]]></end_of_life_cost>      <renewable_ecm id="1">        <zero_loss_efficiency_Î·0><![CDATA[0,741]]></zero_loss_efficiency_Î·0>        <heat_loss_coefficient_k1 unit="[W/m2k]"><![CDATA[1,764]]></heat_loss_coefficient_k1>        <heat_loss_coefficientk2 unit="[W/m2k2]"><![CDATA[0,0029]]></heat_loss_coefficientk2>      </renewable_ecm>    </level>  </component_catalogue></ECM>
